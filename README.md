# Prevention through Design (PtD) to Make Solar-Ready Houses Safe for Solar Workers


## Research Objectives

The overall objective of the study is to develop knowledge and resources that support the application of prevent through design (PtD) to the design of new solar-ready houses. The study will provide evidence that (1) PtD can improve solar worker safety by proactively eliminating safety hazards and mitigating risk; and (2) designers can proactively get involved in promoting PtD for solar-ready houses.

The specific aims of this study are to: (1) investigate design features that support the application of PtD to the design of solar-ready houses by identifying features that either eliminate or create safety risks; (2) categorize components of solar-ready houses that affect safety risk; (3) analyze the identified design features and components through case studies; and (4) develop a PtD design checklist and building information modeling (BIM) model that can be used for making new solar-ready houses safe for solar workers. The study targets solar contractors and their safety, specifically those who work in small businesses. Successful completion of the study will result in the creation of a PtD checklist and procedure which provide house designers the ability to effectively implement PtD for solar-ready houses.

Using mixed methods, the specific tasks of the research are as follows:

1. Perform literature review
2. Investigate design features for solar safety
3. Categorize the components of solar-ready houses
4. Perform case studies of existing solar-ready houses
5. Develop a PtD design checklist and BIM model for new solar-ready houses
6. Obtain industry feedback on the checklist and model
7. Develop and submit a final report
