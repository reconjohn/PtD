## Ideal design for safety from the interviews
* Roof pitch: lower than 5/12 â€“ 7/12 `to work easy - fall`
* Roof material: composition `not to be slippery - fall`
* Roof structure: no obstruction `not to be interrupted - trip, complexity`
* Roof condition: accessories pre-installed `to reduce the scope - complexity`
* Anchor point: pre-installed `to be efficient - fall`
* Access: low height, `enough space for easier access - fall`
* Additional: setback, snow guard, guardrail `fall`
* Electrical: micro inverter, conduit pre-run, reserving spaces, `electric shock, complexity`
