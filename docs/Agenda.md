## Ideal design for safety from the interviews
* Roof pitch: lower than 5/12 – 7/12 `to work easy - fall`
* Roof material: composition `not to be slippery - fall`
* Roof structure: no obstruction `not to be interrupted - trip, complexity`
* Roof condition: accessories pre-installed `to reduce the scope - complexity`
* Anchor point: pre-installed `to be efficient - fall`
* Access: low height, `enough space for easier access - fall`
* Additional: setback, snow guard, guardrail `fall`
* Electrical: micro inverter, conduit pre-run, reserving spaces, `electric shock, complexity`

## Survey (linkert scale)
* Relevance to risk
* Applicability
* Cost-effectiveness

For the below suggestions:
* Roof pitch:
  * Lower than 5/12 – 7/12 for safety
  * Lower pitch - any material fine for safety
  * No ballast mount on flat roof - pre-installed base
* Roof material
  * Composition for safety
  * Durable roof material  - metal
  * Dehydration - composition, TPO
  * Aesthetic roof material - composition
* Roof structure
  * No obstruction for saftey
  * Complicated roof shape - composition or simple roof shape
  * Roof condition: accessories pre-installed
* Access
  * Anchor point: pre-installed
  * Low height for safety
  * Creative access point for material, people
  * Additional - Setback, snow guard, guardrail
  * Lower pitch
* Electrical
  * Micro inverter
  * Conduit pre-run
  * Reserving spaces
  * Same side of BOS installation
* Ergonomy
  * Communication - modular solar system
