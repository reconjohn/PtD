Energy info.
> The cost of the land was $180,000, and construction, solar panels, taxes, and permits added another $237,000. After a $9,000 federal rebate for the solar panels, and an approximately $9,000 WA solar production credit (paid out over 9 years), the grand total came to about $399,000. We were pleased because the cost to build was only $124 per square foot ($114 if you count the rebates and incentives), whereas the average in Seattle is $200 per square foot. Plus, we wonâ€™t be paying for energy, which comes to about $150 per month, or $1,800 per year, for the average Seattle household.
