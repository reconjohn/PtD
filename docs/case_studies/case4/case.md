# Case study - GRANDMA'S HOUSE (NET ZERO) at Carkeek Park, Seattle, WA

Grandma’s House is built to net zero standards, meaning that it produces as much energy as it consumes on an annual basis. It features solar panels, a heat pump, radiant floor heat, triple-pane windows, SIPs, rainwater harvesting, an electrical vehicle charger, and a home energy monitor. Dan Allison, Project Lead at Abode, wanted to lead by example and show that building a net zero home can be cost effective. Grandma’s House won the 2015 Green Building Slam Award, co-sponsored by the Northwest EcoBuilding Guild and the UW Integrated Design Lab.
