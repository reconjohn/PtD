# Checklist

## Solar zone area

> **Safety hazards: trip, fall, complexity**

> **Survey: the majority of professionals consider one continuous zone is desirable than split zones.**

* Design a simple roof shape where the solar zone is present (e.g., complex roof shape could be limited to compositions). 
* Have no obstructions around the zone to avoid trip hazard.
* Prepare mounting accessories of the solar system for the future installation (e.g., penetration, flashing, capped sleave).
* Have access pathways between the zone and the roof edge to avoid fall hazrd.

```
### Code requirements
  * Away from any obstructions (D > 2 H) - CEC
  * Setbacks around the zone (3 ft) - IFC
  * South facing roof (110 - 270 degree) when sloped pitch (over 2/12) - IECC
  * One dimension over 5 ft - IECC
  * Sub zone over 80 sqft - IECC
  * Total zone over 300 sqft (150 sqft if townhouses) - IECC
  * Load to be designed with PV over 4 lbs/ sq - Seattle residential code
  * Solar panels are less than 18" above roof surface - Seattle residential code
  * Solar panels are less than highest roof pitch - Seattle residential code
  * Dead weight	< 5 lb/ sf - Seattle residential code
  * System < 50 lb on a single section - Seattle residential code

```

## Solar zone material

> **Safety hazards: slip, fire, heat stroke, complexity, rework, maintenance**

> **Survey: compositions are the most desirable for the safety criteria while metal (standing seam) is the one as far as applicability is concerned. When it comes to the cost-effectiveness compositions and metal are considered almost the same. In general metal is expensive with higher upfront cost. But, with respect to durability and maintenance, metal could be cost-effective as good as compositions.**

* Avoid vulnerable materials (e.g., tile an shake) for the solar system to sits on.
* Check the durability with respect to the expected period to use the solar system (e.g., if the system goes more than 30 years, compositions may be limited). 
* Design the material with supporting bases (e.g., flashing, penetration) of the solar system.
* To avoid heat stroke of workers in summer, avoid reflected materials.
* If metal, match the lip size of the standing seam with the standard of clamps of the solar system.


```
### Tile and shake
* Tile and shake are easy to crack.
* Tile and shake take longer to install the solar system on them.
* Shakes have fire hazard.

### Compositions
* If the roof shape is complicated, take account of composition. 
* Composition is poor in maintenace and involving moss growth if in rainy climate.
* Composition incurs reinstallation of the solar system, costing about 25% of the initial cost.

### Metal
* Consider metal for durablabilty (about 50 to 100 years).
* Metal features a slip hazard.
* Standardized standing seam entails no penetration for installation of the solar system.
* Working on metal roof in summer may incur heat stroke.
```

## Solar zone pitch

> **Safety hazards: slip, fall, complexity, maintenance**

> **Survey: flat is the safest feature while lower slope is the desirable for cost-effectiveness. Mounting type related to the flat is ballast mounting while the rack type is more desirable than ballast type for applicability and cost-effectiveness. For the safety criteria, there was not difference between the options while solar contractors chose ballast as safer.**

* Identify the solar zone pitch, especially flat leading to ballast mounting and TPO roof material (i.e., if flat, ballast mounting for the solar system and TPO or other similar material are likely to be determined). 
* If rack, design and provide with supporting bases in advance (intervention with membrane, if flat).
* If ballast, conduct structural engineering about the dead and live load for the future solar system (at least additional 6 lbs/ sqft).
* If it is steep metal roof in the climate with snow, conduct a study of snow collection on the roof to avoid snow collection on the system due to snow slide. 
* Identify slip hazard in terms of the roof material, if steep roof (e.g., metal has more risk).
* Assess how to walk around the roof, if steep roof. 

```
### Flat
* Flat roof requires a ballast mounting for the solar system. 
* Hard access to the roof may occur (mostly taller housings for securing more space). 
* Additional structural engineering is required for ballast mounting and weights of the future solar system.
* Membrane penetration with water intrusion should be discussed. 
* Take into account of mounting accessories of the solar system to avoid future penetration leading to involvement of roofing experts to install the solar system.
* A solar system on ballast mounting incurs engineering cost and building permit.
* Flat roof is harder to have overhang, which is necessary in the climate such as Seattle to protect the house from the frequent rain. 

### Membrane on a flat roof: Minimum slope for water to run off is 1% (1/8" per 1'). However, minimum slope for a flat roof by building code is 2%. (1/4" per 1') while a type of membrane roofing may be necessary.

### Sloped 
* Have lower than 5/12 – 7/12 depending on the material for occupational safety. 
* Optimal production is depending on the local attitude (e.g., 8/12 is the optimal in Northwest). 

### Low-slop roof: OSHA defines a "low-slope roof" as a roof having a slope of less than or equal to 4 inches of vertical rise for every 12 inches horizontal length (4:12) (1926.500(b)—definitions). This is important because the OSHA definition is used as a basis for implementing low-slope fall-protection measures, such as warningline systems and safety monitors.

OSHA 1926.501(b)(10): ... each employee engaged in roofing activities on low-slope roofs, with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or a combination of warning line system and guardrail system, warning line system and safety net system, or warning line system and personal fall arrest system, or warning line system and safety monitoring system. Or, on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width (see Appendix A to subpart M of this part), the use of a safety monitoring system alone [i.e. without the warning line system] is permitted.

```


## Fall protection

> **Safety hazards: slip, fall**

> **Survey: hitch clip or tie-off is the feature chosen the most for the safety criteria. There were some other suggestions such as guardrail and snow guards.** 

* Identify fall protection measures around roof edges (e.g., guardrail).
* Keep setback pathways to hip, valley, eave and edge to prevent from fall. 
* Install anchor points (i.e., more risk to install them after construction). 
* Make a maintenance plan for the installed anchor points (i.e., there is a liability issue with homeonwers for installation of anchor point while it is not required in the building code). 
* Consider additional options (setback, snow guard and guardrail)

```
### Snow guards: rooftop devices that allow snow and ice to drop off in small amounts or allow snow and ice to melt completely before falling to the ground. The installation of snow guards prevents the sudden release of snow and ice from a roof, which is known as a roof avalanche. 

### Anchor point: OSHA standard regarding anchorages can be found in 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15): Anchorages used for attachment of personal fall arrest equipment shall be independent of any anchorage being used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds (22.2 kN) per employee attached, or shall be designed, installed, and used as follows: 1926.502(d)(15)(i) as part of a complete personal fall arrest system which maintains a safety factor of at least two; and 1926.502(d)(15)(ii) under the supervision of a qualified person.

OSHA 1926.501(b)(11): ... Each employee on a steep roof with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems with toeboards, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.

IFC 605.11.3.2.1 Residential buildings with hip roof layouts. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with hip roof layouts shall be located in a manner that provides a 3-foot-wide (914 mm) clear access pathway from the eave to the ridge on each roof slope where the panels/modules are located. The access pathway shall be located at a structurally strong location on the building capable of supporting the live load of fire fighters accessing the roof. (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).

IFC 605.11.3.2.2 Residential buildings with a single ridge. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with a single ridge shall be located in a manner that provides two, 3-foot-wide (914 mm) access pathways from the eave to the ridge on each roof slope where panels/modules are located (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).

IFC 605.11.3.2.3 Residential buildings with roof hips and valleys. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with roof hips and valleys shall be located no closer than 18 inches to a hip or valley where panels/modules are to be placed on both sides of a hip or valley. Where panels are to be located on only one side of a hip or valley that is of equal length, the panels shall be permitted to be placed directly adjacent to the hip or valley. (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).
```


## Access to roof

> **Safety hazards: slip, trip, fall**

> **Survey: scaffolding and mechanical lift were chosen to be desirable for safety. Ladder is the most desirable for the cost-effectiveness and applicability.**

* If ballast, assess how to carry heavy materials to the roof.
* Consider lower height of the housing, which is desirable for the safety of people accessing the roof. 
* Consider lower pitch, which makes easier access to the roof. 
* Make an access plan for delivery of material and people (dependent on neighborhood). 
* Consider overhead powerlines when designing. 

```
### Ladder: angle 75 degree, one-quarter the working length of the ladder (a 1:4 ratio) (29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(5)(i)). 3 rungs (1 ft apart) above the roof, The side rails of the ladder generally must extend at least 3 feet above the upper landing surface that the worker is trying to access (29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(1)).

### Access and pathway (Fire code)
If met by the conditions below, it will be waived.
* Having an automated fire sprinkler
* Roof pitch <= 2:12
* System area < 33% total roof area (less than 1,000 sf), but with 18" pathway from ridge
* Detached, noninhabitable such as storage shed

IFC 605.11.3.1 Roof access point. Roof access points shall be located in areas that do not require the placement of ground ladders over openings such as windows or doors, and located at strong points of building construction in locations where the access point does not conflict with overhead obstructions such as tree limbs, wires, or signs.

If not met, then access points to be,
* At strong points
* Not requiring for ground ladders over openings
* No overhead obstructions
* System < 150 ft x 150 ft
* PV sits 18" below the ridge, 3 ft from edges

IFC 605.11.3.2.4 Residential buildings with smoke ventilation. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings shall be located no higher than 3 feet below the ridge in order to allow for fire department smoke ventilation operations.
```

## Conduit for the future solar system

> **Safety hazards: complexity, rework**

> **Survey: most of respondents vote for running conduits in advance for safety, applicability and cost-effectiveness.**

* Have all wire systems close to ridge, hip or valley. 
* Install conduit during construction if conserning the internal conduit run to avoid opening walls later. 
* Consider aesthetics on conduit pathways, inverter, and BOS locations. 
* Reserve spaces on the same side of the solar system for the electric equipments. 

```
IFC 605.11.1.2: Conduit, wiring systems, raceways for photovoltaic circuits shall be located as close as possible to the ridge or hip or valley, and from the hip or valley as directly as possible to outside wall to reduce trip hazard and maximize ventilation opportunity.

### Outside conduit: if protection sections are not more than 10 ft or 10 % of the circuit length, then free air ampacities can be used. NEC 310.15(A)(2); if 4 - 6 current carrying conductors are bundled in the same conduit, 80 % adjustment is needed for conduit fill. NEC Table 310.15(B)(3)(a)

### Conduit spec: fill (NFPA 70 NEC, Article 310); type (NFPA 70 NEC, Article 690); size (NFPA 70 NEC, Article 300)
```


## Solar system inverter

> **Safety hazards: fall, trip, electrocution** 

> **Survey: micro inverter was chosen as the most desirable for the safety. When it comes to applicability and cost-effectiveness, there are not much differences among the features. In practice, depending on the solar system and the roof condition, the desirable inverter would be different. Larger capacity of the system would need string inverters like the case in commercial projects. The point is where the inverter converts DC to AC. Micro inverter does it on the solar zone which leads to the safest feature among other inverter options on electrical safety. On the other hand, micro inverter or optimizer can pose a trip hazard when they are installed on the rails as they entail more wires up on the roof unlike a string inverter, which requires less time on the roof, thus could be safer. ** 

* Consider micro inverter or power optimizer with resepct to rapid shutdown requirements (NEC). 
* Consider micro inverter or power optimizer to avoid DC electric shock.
* Consider string inverter to avoid trip hazard and longer time working on the roof.
* Consider micro inverter or power optimizer for a small system about less than 35 panels for cost-effectiveness. 

```
### Micro inverter and power optimizer: more desirable for smaller systems and more dynamic conditions such as marginal shading and complicated roof. Micro inverter leads to having many electronic components on the zone requiring more maintenance cost. Power optimizer on the other hand, still has a central inverter unlike micro inverter while having the similar performance as the micro inverter.

### NEC rapid shutdown: The Section 690.12 update to the 2017 National Electrical Code (NEC) calls for module-level rapid shutdown of solar systems instead of NEC 2014’s array-level shutdown requirement. Starting Jan. 1, 2019 when NEC 2017 goes into effect in certain jurisdictions, all conductors within an array’s 1-ft boundary have to be reduced to 80 V or less within 30 seconds of rapid shutdown initiation.

### A fatal electrocution: a recent incident cited by OSHA about fatal electrocution leading to the company facing panelties at Kansas. OSHA Wichita Area Director, Ryan Hodge (2019) mentioned, "This tragedy could have been prevented if the employer had complied with electrical standards that require maintaining a safe distance from unprotected energized power lines, training employees, and providing personal protective equipment." 
```


## Standardized modularization

* Consider modular solar system for easier and faster install
* Take into account of standardized design templates in a packet to reduce coordination cost

```
Soft cost cut (related labor) features (vs. Germany; Morris, J., K. Calhoun, J. Goodman, and D. Seif. 2014. “Reducing Solar PV Soft Costs: A Focus on Installation Labor.” In 2014 IEEE 40th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC), 3356–61. https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2014.6925654.)
  * Integrative Racking
  * Process Optimization
  * Clay Tile Base Revamp
  * PV-Ready Electrical Circuits
  * One day installation
  * Steep roof redesign
  * Scaffolding / Safety Nets
  * Conduit Redesign
```


## Interdependent features 
* **Solar zone material and pitch**: Roof pitch affects the material to use for roofing. Higher slope would worsen the use of metal roof for safety - `slip`
* **Solar zone area and pitch**: (1) Roof pitch will decide the complexity of the roof. The steep roof will require less obstruction for the safety of installers - `trip, complexity`; (2) Steep roof requires accessories to be pre-installed to reduce the risk of worker's safety - `complexity`
* **Fall protection and solar zone pitch**: Sloped roof requires tie-off to be pre-installed before the work starts - `fall`; (2) Other options (e.g., setback, snow guard, guardrail) could be implemented for the steep roof - `fall`
* **Access to roof and solar zone pitch**: Sloped roof requires enough space for easier access - `fall`

```
### Conflicts of objectives: there are conflicts of different objectives in terms of safety. Composition materials, flat pitch, scaffolding or mechanical lift for accessing the roof, and micro inverter are the most desirable features in an independent perspective for safety while the most desirable set of features could be variable and context dependent. Nevertheless, one continuous solar zone area, tie-off fall protection, and running conduit in advance are the features to enhance the safety of the current practice.
