## Checklist (Roof pitch)

### Safety concerns

#### Flat roof
* Carrying heavy weight of ballast mounting on flat roof
* Hard access to the flat roof
* Safer to work on flat roof
* Heavy carry to the flat roof due to the access

#### Steep roof
* Snow collection on panel of metal and steep roof
* Hard to work on

> OSHA defines a `low-slope roof` as a roof having a slope of less than or equal to 4 inches of vertical rise for every 12 inches horizontal length (4:12) (1926.500(b)—definitions). This is important because the OSHA definition is used as a basis for implementing low-slope fall-protection measures, such as warningline systems and safety monitors.

#### Metal roof
* Slippery on metal roof
* Dehydration from sun reflection on metal roof
* Snow collection on panel of metal and steep roof
* Composition for complicated roof

#### Other concerns
* Additional structural engineering on flat roof
* Expensive cost for flat roof as complicated due to the penetration of membrane
* Roof slope: negative correlation between electricity production and occupational safety

> OSHA 1926.501(b)(10): ... each employee engaged in roofing activities on low-slope roofs, with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or a combination of warning line system and guardrail system, warning line system and safety net system, or warning line system and personal fall arrest system, or warning line system and safety monitoring system. Or, on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width (see Appendix A to subpart M of this part), the use of a safety monitoring system alone [i.e. without the warning line system] is permitted.

> OSHA 1926.501(b)(11): ... Each employee on a steep roof with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems with toeboards, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.

### Code requirements

#### Building code
* System < 18" above roof surface
* System < highest roof pitch

#### Access and pathway (Fire code)

* All wire systems close to ridge, hip or valley

> IFC 605.11.1.2: Conduit, wiring systems, raceways for photovoltaic circuits shall be located as close as possible to the ridge or hip or valley, and from the hip or valley as directly as possible to outside wall to reduce trip hazard and maximize ventilation opportunity.

If met by the conditions below, it will be waived.
* Having an automated fire sprinkler
* Roof pitch <= 2:12
* System area < 33% total roof area (less than 1,000 sf), but with 18" pathway from ridge
* Detached, noninhabitable such as storage shed

> IFC 605.11.3.1 Roof access point. Roof access points shall be located in areas that do not require the placement of ground ladders over openings such as windows or doors, and located at strong points of building construction in locations where the access point does not conflict with overhead obstructions such as tree limbs, wires, or signs.

If not met, then access points to be,
* At strong points
* Not requiring for ground ladders over openings
* No overhead obstructions
* System < 150 ft x 150 ft
* PV sits 18" below the ridge, 3 ft from edges

> IFC 605.11.3.2.1 Residential buildings with hip roof layouts. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with hip roof layouts shall be located in a manner that provides a 3-foot-wide (914 mm) clear access pathway from the eave to the ridge on each roof slope where the panels/modules are located. The access pathway shall be located at a structurally strong location on the building capable of supporting the live load of fire fighters accessing the roof. (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).

> IFC 605.11.3.2.2 Residential buildings with a single ridge. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with a single ridge shall be located in a manner that provides two, 3-foot-wide (914 mm) access pathways from the eave to the ridge on each roof slope where panels/modules are located (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).

> IFC 605.11.3.2.3 Residential buildings with roof hips and valleys. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with roof hips and valleys shall be located no closer than 18 inches to a hip or valley where panels/modules are to be placed on both sides of a hip or valley. Where panels are to be located on only one side of a hip or valley that is of equal length, the panels shall be permitted to be placed directly adjacent to the hip or valley. (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).

> IFC 605.11.3.2.4 Residential buildings with smoke ventilation. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings shall be located no higher than 3 feet below the ridge in order to allow for fire department smoke ventilation operations.

### Interview results
* Lower than 5/12 – 7/12 depending on the roof material, if it is metal roof, then the slope should be lower to work easy - `fall hazard`

### Related buliding components
* **Roof material**: Roof pitch affects the material to use for roofing. Higher slope would worsen the use of metal roof - `fall hazard`
* **Roof structure**: Roof pitch will decide the complexity of the roof. The steeper roof will require less obstruction for the safety of installers - `trip hazard`, `work complexity`
* **Roof condition**: Steeper roof requires accessories to be pre-installed to reduce the risk of worker's safety - `work complexity`
* **Anchor point**: Sloped roof requires tie-off to be pre-installed before the work starts - `fall hazard`
* **Access**: Sloped roof requires enough space for easier access - `fall hazard`
* **Additional**: Other options could be implemented for the steep roof - *setback, snow guard, guardrail* - `fall hazard`
