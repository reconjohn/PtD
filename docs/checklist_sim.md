## Solar zone area
- [ ] Design a simple roof shape where the solar zone is present (e.g., complex roof shape could be limited to compositions).
- [ ] Have no obstructions around the zone to avoid trip hazard.
- [ ] Prepare mounting accessories of the solar system for the future installation (e.g., penetration, flashing, capped sleeve).
- [ ] Have access pathways between the zone and the roof edge to avoid fall hazard.

## Solar zone material
- [ ] Avoid vulnerable materials (e.g., tile an shake) for the solar system to sits on.
- [ ] Check the durability with respect to the expected period to use the solar system (e.g., if the system goes more than 30 years, compositions may be limited).
- [ ] Design the material with supporting bases (e.g., flashing, penetration) of the solar system.
- [ ] To avoid heat stroke of workers in summer, avoid reflected materials.
- [ ] If metal, match the lip size of the standing seam with the standard of clamps of the solar system.

## Solar zone pitch
- [ ] Identify the solar zone pitch, especially flat leading to ballast mounting and TPO roof material (i.e., if flat, ballast mounting for the solar system and TPO or other similar material are likely to be determined).
- [ ] If rack, design and provide with supporting bases in advance (intervention with membrane, if flat).
- [ ] If ballast, conduct structural engineering about the dead and live load for the future solar system (at least additional 6 lb/ sqft).
- [ ] If it is steep metal roof in the climate with snow, conduct a study of snow collection on the roof to avoid snow collection on the system due to snow slide.
- [ ] Identify slip hazard in terms of the roof material, if steep roof (e.g., metal has more risk).
- [ ] Assess how to walk around the roof, if steep roof.

## Fall protection
- [ ] Identify fall protection measures around roof hip, valley, eave and edge (e.g., guardrail).
- [ ] Keep setback pathways to hip, valley, eave and edge to prevent from fall.
- [ ] Install anchor points (i.e., more risk to install them after construction).
- [ ] Make a maintenance plan for the installed anchor points (i.e., there is a liability issue with homeowners for installation of anchor point while it is not required in the building code).
- [ ] Consider additional options (e.g., setback, snow guard and guardrail)

## Access to roof
- [ ] If ballast, assess how to carry heavy materials to the roof.
- [ ] Consider lower height, which is desirable for the safety of people accessing the roof.
- [ ] Consider lower pitch, which makes easier access to the roof.
- [ ] Make an access plan for delivery of material and people (dependent on neighborhood).
- [ ] Consider overhead powerlines when designing.

## Conduit for the future solar system
- [ ] Have all wire systems close to ridge, hip or valley.
- [ ] Install conduit during construction if concerning the internal conduit run to avoid opening walls later.
- [ ] Consider aesthetics on conduit pathways, inverter, and BOS locations.
- [ ] Reserve spaces on the same side of the solar system for the electric equipment.

## Solar system inverter
- [ ] Consider micro inverter or power optimizer with respect to rapid shutdown requirements (NEC).
- [ ] Consider micro inverter or power optimizer to avoid DC electric shock.
- [ ] Consider string inverter to avoid trip hazard and longer time working on the roof.
- [ ] Consider micro inverter or power optimizer for a small system about less than 35 panels for cost-effectiveness.

## Standardized modularization
- [ ] Consider modular solar system for easier and faster install
- [ ] Take into account of standardized design templates in a packet to reduce coordination cost
