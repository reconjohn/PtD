## OSHA
* Roof slope: OSHA defines a low-slope roof as a roof having a slope of less than or equal to 4 inches of vertical rise for every 12 inches horizontal length (4:12) (1926.500(b)â€”definitions). This is important because the OSHA definition is used as a basis for implementing low-slope fall-protection measures, such as warningline systems and safety monitors.

* Ladder: angle 75 degree, one-quarter the working length of the ladder (a 1:4 ratio) (29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(5)(i)). 3 rungs (1 ft apart) above the roof, The side rails of the ladder generally must extend at least 3 feet above the upper landing surface that the worker is trying to access (29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(1)).

* Anchor: OSHA standard regarding anchorages can be found in 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15): Anchorages used for attachment of personal fall arrest equipment shall be independent of any anchorage being used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds (22.2 kN) per employee attached, or shall be designed, installed, and used as follows: 1926.502(d)(15)(i) as part of a complete personal fall arrest system which maintains a safety factor of at least two; and 1926.502(d)(15)(ii) under the supervision of a qualified person.

> OSHA 1926.501(b)(10): ... each employee engaged in roofing activities on low-slope roofs, with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or a combination of warning line system and guardrail system, warning line system and safety net system, or warning line system and personal fall arrest system, or warning line system and safety monitoring system. Or, on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width (see Appendix A to subpart M of this part), the use of a safety monitoring system alone [i.e. without the warning line system] is permitted.

> OSHA 1926.501(b)(11): ... Each employee on a steep roof with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems with toeboards, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.

## Incident reports
A recent incident cited by OSHA about fatal electrocution leading to the company facing panelties at Kansas.

>"This tragedy could have been prevented if the employer had complied with electrical standards that require maintaining a safe distance from unprotected energized power lines, training employees, and providing personal protective equipment," said OSHA Wichita Area Director Ryan Hodge.
