  abstract = {Every year the construction industry accounts for a disproportionate injury rate when compared to the all-industry average. In recent years, incident rates have declined as a result of improvements in safety management. While there is a great deal of knowledge regarding the safety management strategies of highly effective construction firms, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of these strategies. Interviews with 26 representatives of construction firms headquartered in the US were undertaken to quantify the cost of implementing common safety programme elements by: (1) quantifying cost for each element per US\$1 million of project scope; and (2) determining the distribution of safety funding to each element. Using these cost data and effectiveness ratings from previous research, the cost-effectiveness of 13 safety programme elements was quantified. The results indicate that the most cost-effective safety programme elements are subcontractor selection and management and upper management support and commitment. Alternatively, the least cost-effective elements are the employment of a full-time safety manager and record-keeping. The information presented in this paper may be used by practitioners to direct resource investments, strategically select a subset of safety programme elements when resources are limited, and to justify additional resource investment in accident prevention.},

  abstract = {Planning construction site layouts involves identifying the positions of temporary facilities on site, and accordingly it has a significant impact on the safety and efficiency of construction operations. Although available models are capable of minimizing the travel cost of resources on site, they do not consider safety as an important and separate objective in the optimization of site layouts. This paper presents the development of an expanded site layout planning model that is capable of maximizing construction safety and minimizing the travel cost of resources on site, simultaneously. The model incorporates newly developed concepts and performance criteria that enable the quantification of construction safety and travel cost of resources on site. The present model is developed in three main phases: (1) formulating decision variables and optimization objectives in this site layout planning problem; (2) identifying and satisfying all practical constraints in this optimization problem; and (3) implementing the model as a multiobjective genetic algorithm. An application example is analyzed to illustrate the use of the model and demonstrate its capabilities in optimizing construction site layouts and generating optimal trade-offs between safety and travel cost of resources on site.},

  title = {Improving {{Safety}} in {{Solar Installations}} through {{Prevention}} through {{Design}}},
  abstract = {The U.S. solar industry has seen a drastic increase in solar systems installed on residential buildings due to the reduced payback periods in recent years. Most solar installations happen on the rooftops of existing houses, creating unique worker safety hazards associated with the existing roof conditions and panel installations. Prevention through design (PtD) has been developed as a proactive method to eliminate safety hazards during the design process. However, no identified study has investigated how PtD can be applied to improve safety in solar panel installations. The objective of this research is to fill this knowledge gap by investigating how, during the process to design the solar panel installations, to address safety concerns in solar system installations for small residential buildings by applying the concept of PtD. Based on a number of interviews and four case studies, this study led to the identification of seven PtD attributes and the development of a safety design protocol that small solar contractors can employ to improve their safety practices. This paper presents the research activities and the PtD attributes that the research team has identified including roof materials, roof slopes, roof accessories, panel layouts, fall protection systems, lifting methods, and electrical systems. The research will provide a valuable contribution to the effort to prevent safety hazards though PtD and improve safety practices in solar installations.},

Solar-ready building design, as the name suggests, refers to designing and constructing a building in a way that facilitates and optimizes the installation of a rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system at some point after the building has been constructed. Solar-ready design can make future PV system installation more cost-effective by reducing the need for infrastructure upgrades, ensuring solar technical feasibility, and planning for PV system optimization. Solar-ready design is not a new concept\textemdash{}several states and municipalities, including California and Tucson, Arizona, have already started including solar-ready design mandates in their building ordinances and policies*\textemdash{}but it is still a relevant one, particularly in areas experiencing new urban development.},
