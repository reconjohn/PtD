## Solar zone area
- [ ] Consider modular solar system for easier and faster installation.
- [ ] Take into account of standardized design templates in a packet to reduce coordination cost.
- [ ] Design a simple roof shape where the solar zone is present (complex roof shape could be limited to compositions for the solar zone material).
- [ ] Have no obstructions around the zone to avoid trip hazard.
- [ ] Prepare mounting accessories of the solar system for the future installation such as penetration, flashing and capped sleeve.
- [ ] Have access pathways between the zone and the roof hip, valley, eave and edge to avoid fall hazard.

## Solar zone material
- [ ] Avoid materials such as tile and shake for the solar system to sits on.
- [ ] Check the durability with respect to the expected period to use the solar system (if the system goes more than 30 years, compositions may be limited).
- [ ] Design the material with supporting bases such as flashing and penetration of the solar system.
- [ ] To avoid heat stroke of workers in summer, avoid reflected materials.
- [ ] If metal is chosen for the material, match the lip size of the standing seam with the standard of clamps of the solar system.

## Solar zone pitch

- [ ] Identify the solar zone pitch such as flat and low slope.
- [ ] Plan solar system layout and provide with supporting bases in advance.

### Flat roof
- [ ] Take into account that flat roof leads to ballast mounting and TPO or other similar roof materials for the solar system.
- [ ] Conduct structural engineering about the dead and live load for the future solar system at least additional 6 lb/ sqft. 
- [ ] Review any intervention of solar system accessories with membrane.

### Sloped roof
- [ ] Identify slip hazard in response to the roof material as steep metal roof has more risk.
- [ ] If it is steep metal roof in the climate with snow, conduct a study of snow collection on the roof to avoid snow collection on the system due to snow slide.
- [ ] Assess how people walk around the roof, especially it is steep roof.

## Fall protection
- [ ] Identify fall protection measures around roof hip, valley, eave and edge such as guardrail.
- [ ] Keep setback pathways to hip, valley, eave and edge to prevent from fall.
- [ ] Install anchor points (it has more risk to install them after construction).
- [ ] Make a maintenance plan for the installed anchor points (there is a liability issue with homeowners for installation of anchor point while it is not required in the building code).
- [ ] Consider additional options such as setback, snow guard and guardrail. 

## Access to roof
- [ ] Assess how to carry heavy materials to the roof, especially for ballast mounting. 
- [ ] Consider lower height for the house, which is desirable for the safety of people accessing the roof.
- [ ] Consider lower solar zone pitch, which makes easier access to the roof.
- [ ] Make an access plan for delivery of material and people depending on neighborhood.
- [ ] Consider any overhead powerlines around the site when designing.

## Electrical considerations for the future solar system

### Conduit 
- [ ] Have all wire systems close to ridge, hip or valley.
- [ ] Install conduit during construction if concerning the internal conduit run to avoid opening walls later.
- [ ] Consider aesthetics on conduit pathways, inverter, and BOS locations.
- [ ] Reserve spaces on the same side of the solar system for the electrical equipment.

### Inverter 
- [ ] Consider micro inverter or power optimizer with respect to rapid shutdown requirements (NEC).
- [ ] Consider micro inverter or power optimizer to avoid DC electric shock.
- [ ] Consider micro inverter or power optimizer for a small system about less than 35 panels for cost-effectiveness.
- [ ] Consider string inverter to avoid trip hazard and longer time working on the roof.
