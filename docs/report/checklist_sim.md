## Solar zone feature

### Solar zone area
- [ ] Consider a modular solar system^[This means to have roof ready for the future solar system] and standardized design templates^[For example, integrative racking, process optimization, PV-ready electrical circuits, and conduit redesign.] for easier and faster installation. 
- [ ] Design a simple roof shape with a designated solar zone^[Complex roof shape makes it harder to install a solar system].
- [ ] Design solar zone by considering the future solar system layout.
- [ ] Have no obstructions such as skylights, chimneys, and vents around the solar zone to prevent tripping hazards.
- [ ] Pre-install mounting accessories^[These are not necessary for standing seam metal roof with appropriate lips as the standardized clamps can assemble racking without penetration.] of a solar system for future installation by considering penetration, flashing, and capped sleeve.
- [ ] Designate access pathways[^1] between the solar zone and the roof hip, valley, eave, or edge, to prevent fall hazards. 
- [ ] Avoid having the solar zone under any overhead^[IFC 605.11.3.2.4 Residential buildings with smoke ventilation. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings shall be located no higher than 3 feet below the ridge in order to allow for fire department smoke ventilation operations.] powerline.  

[^1]: IFC 605.11.3.2.1 Residential buildings with hip roof layouts. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with hip roof layouts shall be located in a manner that provides a 3-foot-wide (914 mm) clear access pathway from the eave to the ridge on each roof slope where the panels/modules are located. The access pathway shall be located at a structurally strong location on the building capable of supporting the live load of fire fighters accessing the roof. (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12). IFC 605.11.3.2.2 Residential buildings with a single ridge. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with a single ridge shall be located in a manner that provides two, 3-foot-wide (914 mm) access pathways from the eave to the ridge on each roof slope where panels/modules are located (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12). IFC 605.11.3.2.3 Residential buildings with roof hips and valleys. Panels/modules installed on residential buildings with roof hips and valleys shall be located no closer than 18 inches to a hip or valley where panels/modules are to be placed on both sides of a hip or valley. Where panels are to be located on only one side of a hip or valley that is of equal length, the panels shall be permitted to be placed directly adjacent to the hip or valley. (Exception: roof slopes ≤ 2:12).

### Solar zone material
- [ ] Avoid using materials such as tile and shake in the solar zone^[Tile is known for the better performance under harsh conditions caused by extreme weather such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Tile roofing is also fireproof and considered to be cheaper than other roofing materials. This type could be typically found in sunnier region such as Arizona. Tile roofing, however, still needs to be evaluated from the safety perspectives on behalf of solar installers as it makes the installation complex.].
- [ ] Check the material durability with respect to the expected lifespan of the solar system and the expected installation timing^[If the system targets 30+ years, the use of composition should be considered with respect to the degradation to composition roofing because of solar exposure. The roofing over the solar panels are expected to last longer. More attention should be paid to the surrounding roofing material.].
- [ ] Select a roofing material by considering supporting bases and penetration of the solar system.
- [ ] If metal roofing is used, make sure the lip size of its standing seams matching the clamp size of the solar system.
- [ ] Take into account possible heat stroke of workers on metal roof in summer^[Reflective roofing such as a cool roof is suggested to absorb less heat while it could affect solar installers on a hot sunny day.].



### Solar zone pitch
- [ ] Apply lower slope^[Low-slope roof: OSHA defines a "low-slope roof" as a roof having a slope of less than or equal to 4 inches of vertical rise for every 12 inches horizontal length (4:12) (1926.500(b)—definitions).] to the solar zone area^[Lower slope benefits safer condition while steep slope could be desirable for the maximum energy production. For example, it is known the slope of 8/12 is optimal for energy production in Northwest.]. 

#### Flat roof
- [ ] Note that flat roof likely requires ballast mounting and other roofing materials^[A single-ply roofing membrane covering the surface of the roof such as TPO (Thermoplastic polyolefin), EPDM and PVC.]. 
- [ ] Add additional load for ballast mounting weights (in addition to 6 LB per square-foot for solar panels and racking) to structural engineering of the roof. 
- [ ] Review any interference of solar system accessories with roof membrane^[Membrane on a flat roof: Minimum slope for water to run off is 1/8" per 1'. Minimum slope for a flat roof by building code is 1/4" per 1'. A type of membrane roofing may be necessary even if its slope is over 2 % (1/4" per 1').].


#### Sloped roof
- [ ] Note that metal roof leads to slip hazards if the slope is considerably higher than low-slope roof. 
- [ ] Consider possible snow collection on the future solar panels if the house is located in the snowy climate.

## Installation feature

### Fall protection
- [ ] Identify fall protection^[OSHA 1926.501(b)(10): ... each employee engaged in roofing activities on low-slope roofs, with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or a combination of warning line system and guardrail system, warning line system and safety net system, or warning line system and personal fall arrest system, or warning line system and safety monitoring system. Or, on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width (see Appendix A to subpart M of this part), the use of a safety monitoring system alone [i.e. without the warning line system] is permitted.] measures (such as setback, snow guard^[Rooftop devices that allow snow and ice to drop off in small amounts or allow snow and ice to melt completely before falling to the ground. The installation of snow guards prevents the sudden release of snow and ice from a roof, which is known as a roof avalanche. Snow guard could support installers and prevent them from falling.] and guardrails^[OSHA 1926.501(b)(11): ... Each employee on a steep roof with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems with toeboards, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.]) around roof hip, valley, eave, and edge.
- [ ] Maintain setback pathways at hip, valley, eave and edge to prevent fall hazards.
- [ ] Pre-install anchor points^[Anchor point: OSHA standard regarding anchorages can be found in 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15): Anchorages used for attachment of personal fall arrest equipment shall be independent of any anchorage being used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds (22.2 kN) per employee attached, or shall be designed, installed, and used as follows: 1926.502(d)(15)(i) as part of a complete personal fall arrest system which maintains a safety factor of at least two; and 1926.502(d)(15)(ii) under the supervision of a qualified person.] and develop a maintenance plan for the installed anchor points^[There is a potential liability issue with pre-installed anchor point because building codes, in general, do not require to install nor maintain the anchor point. A homeowner may be in trouble if an accident happens due to the poorly installed or maintained anchor point.]. 


### Access to roof
- [ ] Assess access points and installation sequences for the future solar system. 
- [ ] Improve access by considering a lower height for the solar zone and lower solar zone pitch. 
- [ ] Develop an access plan^[IFC 605.11.3.1 Roof access point. Roof access points shall be located in areas that do not require the placement of ground ladders over openings such as windows or doors, and located at strong points of building construction in locations where the access point does not conflict with overhead obstructions such as tree limbs, wires, or signs.] for how to carry heavy materials (such as solar panels, racking and ballast mounting) to the roof by considering neighboring houses^[Ladder: angle 75 degree, one-quarter the working length of the ladder (a 1:4 ratio) (29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(5)(i)). 3 rungs (1 ft apart) above the roof, The side rails of the ladder generally must extend at least 3 feet above the upper landing surface that the worker is trying to access (29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(1)).]. 


## Electrical features for the future solar system

### Conduit 
- [ ] Pre-install conduit^[Outside conduit: if protection sections are not more than 10 ft or 10 % of the circuit length, then free air ampacities can be used. NEC 310.15(A)(2); if 4 - 6 current carrying conductors are bundled in the same conduit, 80 % adjustment is needed for conduit fill. NEC Table 310.15(B)(3)(a). Conduit spec: fill (NFPA 70 NEC, Article 310); type (NFPA 70 NEC, Article 690); size (NFPA 70 NEC, Article 300)], wiring systems, and raceways for photovoltaic circuits, in close proximity to ridge, hip or valley^[IFC 605.11.1.2: Conduit, wiring systems, raceways for photovoltaic circuits shall be located as close as possible to the ridge or hip or valley, and from the hip or valley as directly as possible to outside wall to reduce trip hazard and maximize ventilation opportunity.].
- [ ] Take into account aesthetics^[Because this is one of the significant factors to homeowners and marketability of the house.] for location of conduit pathways, inverter, and balance of system (BOS)^[The balance of system (BOS) encompasses all components of a photovoltaic system other than the photovoltaic panels.].
- [ ] Designate a preferably shaded space for electrical equipment in close proximity to the solar system to prevent any sun damage^[More sun exposure would curtail power, and shorten equipment life by heating the components.].   


### Inverter 
- [ ] Consider micro inverters or power optimizers for rapid shutdown^[NEC rapid shutdown: The Section 690.12 update to the 2017 National Electrical Code (NEC) calls for module-level rapid shutdown of solar systems instead of NEC 2014’s array-level shutdown requirement. Starting Jan. 1, 2019 when NEC 2017 goes into effect in certain jurisdictions, all conductors within an array’s 1-ft boundary have to be reduced to 80 V or less within 30 seconds of rapid shutdown initiation.] to avoid direct current (DC) electric shock^[A fatal electrocution: a recent incident cited by OSHA about fatal electrocution leading to the company facing penalties at Kansas. OSHA Wichita Area Director, Ryan Hodge (2019) mentioned, "This tragedy could have been prevented if the employer had complied with electrical standards that require maintaining a safe distance from unprotected energized power lines, training employees, and providing personal protective equipment."].
- [ ] Consider micro inverters or power optimizers for small systems^[A system with less than 35 panels is economical to have micro inverters or power optimizers.] for electrical safety.
- [ ] Consider string inverters for larger systems^[Typically a system with more than 35 panels is economical to have a string inverter. Micro inverters with a large system entails many electronic components on roof] to prevent tripping hazards and to reduce the time spent on roof for installation.
