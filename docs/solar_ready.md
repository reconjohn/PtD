# Survey (likert scale)
* Relevance to risk
* Applicability
* Cost-effectiveness

# The most hazardous work processes to the workers
* **Install safety equipment**
* Chalk roof layout
* Install mounting sys.
* Install grounding, overcurrent protection device (OCPD)
* **Lift PV**
* Position PV
* Install accessories
* Test operation

> The most hazards on roof, installation process are fall, trip, electric shock, falling objects, heat/ cold stress, material handling, and so on - OSHA

## Solar ready benefits
* Economical - cheaper
    * Saving soft cost (permitting, pre-construction engineering, marketing, installation labor time at risk of being on the roof and live electrical conductors)
    * Additional work, however, if solar ready scope was wrong
    
```
Solar ready scope cost saving: New vs. retrofit (NREL, 2012)
Solar installed cost: New vs. retrofit (Barbose, 2014)
```

* Productivity - faster (easier)
    * Having solar ready on the flat roof prevents the roof from penetration
* Occupational safety
    * Easier access, simple layout, no tripping hazard, no openings
    * Working less and easier makes more occupational safety
* Marketability 
    * Solar ready enhancing the value of the home
* Green adoption
    * Promoting awareness of PV

## To consider
* Solar incentives such as tax credit not covering solar ready scope
* Some incentives for solar ready, but rare 

```
OR energy trust EPS: incentives to builders (Governer Kate Brown. Executive order)
```

* Standardization - different per jurisdictions
* Permitting proceses through enforcing buliding code - current trend
* Split-incentives (builder and user) - voluntary to requirement
* Minimal cost for design change favoring solar ready
* Addiontal cost for solar ready scope is around $1,000
* Designers focus more on efficiency measures so that less energy needs to be provided thus, less solar panels are required to be installed
* Neighborhood involvement on design decision
* Maintenance of panel to clean due to dust

The Twelve Essential Steps to Net Zero Energy with Ted Clifton
  1. building orientation (facing south)
  2. simple design (cube)
  3. window orientation and correct overhang (facing south)
  4. thermal mass
  5. tight building envelope
  6. balanced insulation
  7. balanced ventilation
  8. heating and cooling equipment
  9. domestic hot water
  10. efficient appliance (e.g. energy star)
  11. efficient lighting
  12. solar panel

## Solar zone features
### Solar zone area
* No obstruction around the zone to avoid trip hazard
* Accessories to be pre-installed
* If complicated roof shape, go for composition, otherwise have simple roof shape
* Safer to have access gaps between panels

```
Code requirements
  * Away from any obstructions (D > 2 H) - CEC
  * Setbacks around the zone (3 ft) - IFC
  * South facing (110 - 270 degree) with sloped pitch (over 2/12) - IECC
  * One dimension over 5 ft - IECC
  * Sub zone over 80 sqft - IECC
  * Total zone over 300 sqft (150 sqft if townhouses) - IECC
  * Load to be designed with PV over 4 lbs/ sq - Seattle residential code
```

### Solar zone pitch
* Lower than 5/12 – 7/12 for occupational safety
* Optimal production is depending on the local attitude (8/12 is the optimal in Northwest)
* If lower pitch, any solar zone material is fine for safety
* Rather than having ballast mount on flat roof, have accessories pre-installed to go for rack unt
* Hard access to the flat roof (mostly for taller housings for securing more space)
* Additional structural engineering is required for ballast mounting and weights
* Membrane penetration issue with water intrusion on flat roof
* Penetration would need roofing experts
* PV system on ballast mounting incurring engineering cost and building permit
* Overhang is necessary in the climate such as Seattle to protect the house from the frequent rain while flat roof is harder to have overhang

> Minimum slope for water to run off is 1% (1/8" per 1'). However, minimum slope for a flat roof by building code here is 2%. (1/4" per 1'). You have more than enough slope for your roof, however you will likely need some sort of membrane roofing since it is very low slope.

### Solar zone material
* Composition is good for safety
* Composition is easier to work on for the complicated roof
* Composition is poor in maintenace and involving moss growth
* Less durable of composition incurs reinstallation, costing 25% of the initial
* Durable roof material is metal
* It is slippery on metal roof
* In general, typical metal roof entails no penetration for installation of PV system that kes easier to install PV system
* To avoid heatstroke, go for composition and TPO
* Tile and shake are easy to crack.
* Tile and shake take longer to install PV system on them
* Shakes have fire hazard
* Aesthetics for roof material


## Installation features
### Fall protection
* Anchor point to be pre-installed (risk to install it after construction)
* Liability issue with homeonwers for installation of anchor point while it is not required in e building code
* Additional options (setback, snow guard and guardrail)

> Snow guards: Rooftop devices that allow snow and ice to drop off in small amounts or allow snow and ice to melt completely before falling to the ground. The installation of snow guards prevents the sudden release of snow and ice from a roof, which is known as a roof avalanche

### Access
* Low height is good for safety
* Creative access point needed for delivery of material and people (dependent on neighborhood)
* Lower pitch makes easier access
* Watch out overhead powerlines

### Electrical
* Conduit to be pre-run as it is complicated for internal conduit-run by opening walls
* Aesthetics to be considered on conduit run and inverter location
* Reserving spaces on the same side for equipments


## Solar system features
### Electrical
* Micro inverter or power optimizer for rapid shutdown requirements (NEC)
* Economical with Micro inverter or power optimizerfor for small system less than 35 panels

### Mounting
* Pre-reflective design to prevent the flat roof from penetration or ballast option

## Standardized modularization
* Modular solar system for easier and faster install
* Standardized design template in a packet to reduce coordination cost
